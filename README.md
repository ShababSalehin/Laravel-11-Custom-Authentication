## Introduction

Welcome to the Laravel 11 Custom Authentication System developed by Shabab Salehin! This application is designed to provide a robust and secure authentication solution built with modern web development technologies. It caters to the common needs of user authentication, including registration, login, profile management, and secure session handling. 

### Project Overview

In this project, users can register using their name, unique email address, unique phone number, and password. Post-registration, users are automatically logged in and redirected to a personalized dashboard. The system includes a profile page where users can update their name and email. For security, the application uses CSRF tokens to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks. Users can log out securely, ensuring their sessions are terminated properly. Additionally, users can log in using their phone number and password, providing a flexible and user-friendly authentication process.

### Motivation

The primary motivation behind this project was to create a scalable and secure authentication system using the latest version of Laravel. The project aims to demonstrate the integration of various technologies such as Laravel, ViteJS, and MySQL, and how they can be used together to build a comprehensive authentication system. This project serves as a valuable resource for developers looking to implement custom authentication solutions in their Laravel applications.

### Features Detailed

- **User Registration**: Users can register by providing their name, a unique email address, a unique phone number, and a password. The registration process includes validation to ensure data integrity and security.
  
- **Automatic Login Post-Registration**: After successful registration, users are automatically logged in and redirected to their dashboard, enhancing user experience by eliminating the need for an additional login step.
